# About me
<hr style="margin: -0.1em 0 !important;">
Hey! Although you do not know my real name, you may call me **V3ded**. My personal research focuses mainly on Active Directory, Windows Sysinternals and System Administration.

This blog is my way of giving back to the community and tracking my own progress over time. I will be posting about various CTFs, personal projects and other topics related to infosec. If there is anything else you would like to see, feel free to reach out to me using any of the platforms listed [below](#socials). That being said, I would also really appreciate any feedback you guys have, so don't be shy!
